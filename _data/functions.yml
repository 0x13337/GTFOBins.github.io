  features: &execution-features
    sudo-enabled: |
      It runs in privileged context and may be used to access the file system,
      escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges if enabled on `sudo`.
    suid-enabled: |
      It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file
      system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a
      SUID backdoor. If it is used to run `/bin/sh -p`, omit the `-p` on systems
      like Debian that allow to run a SUID shell by default.
    suid-limited: |
      It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file
      system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a
      SUID backdoor. Running `/bin/sh` only works on Debian systems that allow
      SUID shell execution by default.
